## <A name="introduction"></A>  Introduction

![CPU versus GPU design](./images/cpu_vs_gpu.png "CPU versus GPU design")

GPU is specialized for compute-intensive, highly parallel computation - exactly what graphics rendering is about - and therefore designed such that more transistors are devoted to data processing rather than data caching and flow control.

The NVIDIA GPU architecture is built around a scalable array of multithreaded Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). When a CUDA program on the host CPU invokes a kernel grid, the blocks of the grid are enumerated and distributed to multiprocessors with available execution capacity. The threads of a thread block execute concurrently on one multiprocessor, and multiple thread blocks can execute concurrently on one multiprocessor. As thread blocks terminate, new blocks are launched on the vacated multiprocessors.

A multiprocessor is designed to execute hundreds of threads concurrently. To manage such a large amount of threads, it employs a unique architecture called SIMT (Single-Instruction, Multiple-Thread). The instructions are pipelined to leverage instruction-level parallelism within a single thread, as well as thread-level parallelism extensively through simultaneous hardware multithreading. Unlike CPU cores they are issued in order however and there is no branch prediction and no speculative execution.

### <A name="terminology"></A> Terminology

* __HOST__: The CPU and its memory (Host Memory)

* __DEVICE__: The GPU and its memory (Device Memory)

* __COMPUTE CAPABILITY__:  The compute capability of a device is represented by a version number, also sometimes called its "SM version". This version number identifies the features supported by the GPU hardware and is used by applications at runtime to determine which hardware features and/or instructions are available on the present GPU.
    * The compute capability version comprises a major and a minor version number (x.y):
        * Devices with the same major revision number are of the same core architecture:
            * 1 = __Telsa__ architecture
            * 2 = __Fermi__ architecture
            * 3 = __Kepler__ architecture
            * 5 = __Maxwell__ architecture
        * The minor revision number corresponds to an incremental improvement to the core architecture, possibly including new features.

Notes:

* _The compute capability version of a particular GPU should not be confused with the CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 5.5, CUDA 6, CUDA 6.5, CUDA 7.0), which is the version of the CUDA software platform._
* _The Tesla architecture (Compute Capability 1.x) is no longer supported starting with CUDA 7.0._

| Architecture specifications  Compute capability (version) | 1.0 | 1.1 | 1.2 | 1.3 | 2.0 | 2.1 | 3.0 | 3.5 | 5.0 |5.2 |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--| 
| _Number of cores for integer and floating-point arithmetic functions operations_ | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 32 | 48 | 192 | 192 | 128 | 128 |

Examples:

* MacBook Pro 15' with NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2 Giga = (two Kepler multiprocessors with Compute Capability 3.0)
    * __384 cores with 2 GB__
* NVIDIA Tesla GPU Accelerator K40
    * __2.880 cores with 12 GB__

## <A name="threadhierarchy"></A> Thread Hierarchy

CUDA C extends C by allowing the programmer to define C functions, called kernels, that, when called, are executed N times in parallel by N different CUDA threads, as opposed to only once like regular C functions.

The CUDA programming model assumes that the CUDA threads execute on a physically separate device that operates as a coprocessor to the host running the C program. This is the case, for example, when the kernels execute on a GPU and the rest of the Golang program executes on a CPU.

Calling a kernel function from the Host launch a grid of thread blocks on the Device:

### <A name="kernel"></A> Kernel

![Thread Hierarchy](./images/grid_of_thread_blocks.png "Thread Hierarchy")

### <A name="thread"></A> Thread
### <A name="warp"></A> Warp

The multiprocessor creates, manages, schedules, and executes threads in groups of 32 parallel threads called warps. Individual threads composing a warp start together at the same program address, but they have their own instruction address counter and register state and are therefore free to branch and execute independently. The term warp originates from weaving, the first parallel thread technology.

## <A name="memory"></A> Memory

The GPU card contains its own DRAM memory separatly from the CPU's DRAM. Let's see how these memory works and can exchange information between them.

### <A name="hostmemory"></A> Host Memory
#### <A name="pagelockedhostmemory"></A> Page-Locked Host Memory
### <A name="devicememory"></A> Device Memory

CUDA threads may access data from multiple memory spaces during their execution:

* __Local memory__
    * Each thread has private local memory (__per-thread local memory__).
    * Local memory is so named because its scope is local to the thread, not because of its physical location. In fact, local memory is off-chip (=DRAM). Hence, access to local memory is as expensive as access to global memory. In other words, the term local in the name does not imply faster access.
* __Shared memory__
    * Each thread block has shared memory visible to all threads of the block and with the same lifetime as the block (__per-block shared memory__).
    * Because it is on-chip, shared memory has much higher bandwidth and lower latency than local and global memory.
* __Global memory__
    * All threads have access to the same global memory (=DRAM).

## <A name="asynchronousconcurrencyexecution"></A> Asynchronous Concurrency Execution
### <A name="concurrentdataaccess"></A> Concurrent Data Access
#### <A name="synchronizefunctions"></A> Synchronize Functions
#### <A name="atomicfunction"></A> Atomic Functions
### <A name="concurrentkernelexecution"></A> Concurrent kernel execution

### <A name="streams"></A> Streams
#### <A name="callbacks"></A> Callbacks
#### <A name="events"></A> Events
### <A name="dynamicparallelism"></A> Dynamic Parallelism

Dynamic Parallelism enables a CUDA kernel to create and synchronize new nested work, using the CUDA runtime API to launch other kernels, optionally
synchronize on kernel completion, perform device memory management, and create and use streams and events, all without CPU involvement. 

__Note: Need Compute Capability >= 3.5__

![Dynamic Parallelism](./images/dynamic_parallelism.jpg "Dynamic Parallelism")

Dynamic Parallelism dynamically spawns new threads by adapting to the data without going back to the CPU, greatly simplifying GPU programming and accelerating  algorithms.

![Dynamic Parallelism](./images/dynamic_parallelism_example.jpg "Dynamic Parallelism")

### <A name="hyperq"></A> Hyper-Q

Hyper-Q enables multiple CPU threads or processes to launch work on a single GPU simultaneously,
thereby dramatically increasing GPU utilization and slashing CPU idle times.
This feature increases the total number of “connections” between the host and GPU by
allowing 32 simultaneous, hardware-managed connections, compared to the single
connection available with GPUs without Hyper-Q.
Hyper-Q is a flexible solution that allows connections for both CUDA streams and Message
Passing Interface (MPI) processes, or even threads from within a process. Existing
applications that were previously limited by false dependencies can see a dramatic
performance increase without changing any existing code.

__Note: Need Compute Capability >= 3.5__

----------------------------

## <A name="multidevicesystem"></A> Multi-Device System

A host system can have multiple GPU Devices.

### <A name="streamandeventbehavior"></A> Stream and Event Behavior

* A kernel launch will fail if it is issued to a stream that is not associated to the current device.
* A memory copy will succeed even if it is issued to a stream that is not associated to the current device.
* Each device has its own default stream, so commands issued to the default stream of a device may execute out of order or concurrently with respect to commands issued to the default stream of any other device.

### <A name="gpudirect"></A> GPU Direct

**Accelerated communication with network and storage devices**  
Network and GPU device drivers can share “pinned” (page-locked) buffers, eliminating the need to make a redundant copy in CUDA host memory.

![RDMA](./images/rdma.png "RDMA")

**Peer-to-Peer Transfers between GPUs**  
Use high-speed DMA transfers to copy data between the memories of two GPUs on the same system/PCIe bus.

**Peer-to-Peer memory access**  
Optimize communication between GPUs using NUMA-style access to memory on other GPUs from within CUDA kernels.

![Peer-to-Peer](./images/peer_to_peer.png "Peer-to-Peer")

**RDMA**  

Eliminate CPU bandwidth and latency bottlenecks using remote direct memory access (RDMA) transfers between GPUs and other PCIe devices, resulting in significantly improved MPISendRecv efficiency between GPUs and other nodes)

**GPUDirect for Video**  
Optimized pipeline for frame-based devices such as frame grabbers, video switchers, HD-SDI capture, and CameraLink devices.

* GPUDirect version 1 supported accelerated communication with network and storage devices. It was supported by InfiniBand solutions available from Mellanox and others.
* GPUDirect version 2 added support for peer-to-peer communication between GPUs on the same shared memory server.
* GPU Direct RDMA enables RDMA transfers across an Infiniband network between GPUs in different cluster nodes, bypassing CPU host memory altogether. 

Using GPUDirect, 3rd party network adapters, solid-state drives (SSDs) and other devices can directly read and write CUDA host and device memory. GPUDirect eliminates unnecessary system memory copies, dramatically lowers CPU overhead, and reduces latency, resulting in significant performance improvements in data transfer times for applications running on NVIDIA products.

## <A name="versioningandcompatibility"></A> Versioning and Compatibility

![Versioning and Compatibility](./images/versioning_and_compatibility.png "Versioning and Compatibility")

* __The driver API is backward compatible__, meaning that applications, plug-ins, and libraries (including the C runtime) compiled against a particular version of the driver API will continue to work on subsequent device driver releases.

* __The driver API is not forward compatible__, which means that applications, plug-ins, and libraries (including the C runtime) compiled against a particular version of the driver API will not work on previous versions of the device driver.

* Only one version of the CUDA device driver can be installed on a system.

* All plug-ins and libraries used by an application must use the same version of:
    * any CUDA libraries (such as cuFFT, cuBLAS, ...)
    * the associated CUDA runtime.
