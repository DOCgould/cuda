![CPU versus GPU design](./images/cpu_vs_gpu.png "CPU versus GPU design")

GPU is specialized for compute-intensive, highly parallel computation - exactly what graphics rendering is about - and therefore designed such that more transistors are devoted to data processing rather than data caching and flow control.

The NVIDIA GPU architecture is built around a scalable array of multithreaded Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). When a CUDA program on the host CPU invokes a kernel grid, the blocks of the grid are enumerated and distributed to multiprocessors with available execution capacity. The threads of a thread block execute concurrently on one multiprocessor, and multiple thread blocks can execute concurrently on one multiprocessor. As thread blocks terminate, new blocks are launched on the vacated multiprocessors.

A multiprocessor is designed to execute hundreds of threads concurrently. To manage such a large amount of threads, it employs a unique architecture called SIMT (Single-Instruction, Multiple-Thread). The instructions are pipelined to leverage instruction-level parallelism within a single thread, as well as thread-level parallelism extensively through simultaneous hardware multithreading. Unlike CPU cores they are issued in order however and there is no branch prediction and no speculative execution.

### <A name="terminology"></A> Terminology

* __HOST__: The CPU and its memory (Host Memory)

* __DEVICE__: The GPU and its memory (Device Memory)

* __COMPUTE CAPABILITY__:  The compute capability of a device is represented by a version number, also sometimes called its "SM version". This version number identifies the features supported by the GPU hardware and is used by applications at runtime to determine which hardware features and/or instructions are available on the present GPU.
    * The compute capability version comprises a major and a minor version number (x.y):
        * Devices with the same major revision number are of the same core architecture:
            * 1 = __Telsa__ architecture
            * 2 = __Fermi__ architecture
            * 3 = __Kepler__ architecture
            * 5 = __Maxwell__ architecture
        * The minor revision number corresponds to an incremental improvement to the core architecture, possibly including new features.

Notes:

* _The compute capability version of a particular GPU should not be confused with the CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 5.5, CUDA 6, CUDA 6.5, CUDA 7.0), which is the version of the CUDA software platform._
* _The Tesla architecture (Compute Capability 1.x) is no longer supported starting with CUDA 7.0._

### <A name="cudasoftwarearchitecture"></A> CUDA Software Architecture

![CUDA Software Architecture](./images/cuda_design.jpg "CUDA Software Architecture")

CUDA is composed of two APIs:

* A low-level API called the __CUDA Driver API__,
* A higher-level API called the __CUDA Runtime API__ that is implemented on top of the CUDA driver API.

These APIs are mutually exclusive: An application should use either one or the other.

* The CUDA runtime eases device code management by providing implicit initialization, context management, and module management.
* In contrast, the CUDA driver API requires more code, is harder to program and debug, but offers a better level of control and is language-independent since it only deals with cubin objects. In particular, it is more difficult to configure and launch kernels using the CUDA driver API, since the execution configuration and kernel parameters must be specified with explicit function calls. Also, device emulation does not work with the CUDA driver API.

The easiest way to write an application that use GPU acceleration is to use existing CUDA libraries if they correspond to your need: cuBLAS, cuRAND, cu FFT, cuSOLVER, cuDNN, ...

If existing libraries do not fit your need then you must write your own GPU functions in C language ( CUDA call them kernels, and CUDA C program have ".cu" file extension ) and use them in your application by using CUDA Runtime API, and linking CUDA Runtime library and your kernels functions to your application.

### <A name="versioningandcompatibility"></A> Versioning and Compatibility

![Versioning and Compatibility](./images/versioning_and_compatibility.png "Versioning and Compatibility")

* __The driver API is backward compatible__, meaning that applications, plug-ins, and libraries (including the C runtime) compiled against a particular version of the driver API will continue to work on subsequent device driver releases.

* __The driver API is not forward compatible__, which means that applications, plug-ins, and libraries (including the C runtime) compiled against a particular version of the driver API will not work on previous versions of the device driver.

* Only one version of the CUDA device driver can be installed on a system.

* All plug-ins and libraries used by an application must use the same version of:
    * any CUDA libraries (such as cuFFT, cuBLAS, ...)
    * the associated CUDA runtime.

----------------------------

## <A name="threadhierarchy"></A> Thread Hierarchy

CUDA C extends C by allowing the programmer to define C functions, called kernels, that, when called, are executed N times in parallel by N different CUDA threads, as opposed to only once like regular C functions.

The CUDA programming model assumes that the CUDA threads execute on a physically separate device that operates as a coprocessor to the host running the C program. This is the case, for example, when the kernels execute on a GPU and the rest of the Golang program executes on a CPU.

__Calling a kernel function from the Host launch a grid of thread blocks on the Device:__

![Heterogeneous Programming](./images/heterogeneous_programming.png "Heterogeneous Programming")

### <A name="kernel"></A> Kernel

A kernel is a special C function defined using the `__global__` declaration specifier and the number of CUDA threads that execute that kernel for a given kernel call is specified using a new `<<<...>>>` execution configuration syntax. Each thread that executes the kernel is given a unique thread ID that is accessible within the kernel through the built-in `threadIdx` variable.

__The following sample code adds two vectors A and B of size 16 and stores the result into vector C:__
```c
// Kernel definition
__global__ void VecAdd(float* A, float* B, float* C) {
  int i = threadIdx.x;
  C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
}

int main() {
   ...
   // Kernel invocation of 1 Block with 16 threads
   VecAdd<<< 1, 16 >>>(A, B, C);
   ...
}
```
Here, each of the 16 threads that execute `VecAdd()` performs one pair-wise addition:

![Kernel invocation 1 Block of 16 Threads](./images/kernel1block16threads.png "Kernel invocation 1 Block of 16 Threads")

### <A name="thread"></A> Thread

For convenience, `threadIdx` is a 3-component vector, so that threads can be identified using a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional thread index, forming a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional thread block. This provides a natural way to invoke computation across the elements in a domain such as a vector, matrix, or volume.

The index of a thread and its thread ID relate to each other in a straightforward way:

* For a one-dimensional block of size (Dx), the thread ID of a thread of index (x) are the same:
    * `= x`
* For a two-dimensional block of size (Dx, Dy), the thread ID of a thread of index (x, y) is:
    * `= x + y*Dx`
* For a three-dimensional block of size (Dx, Dy, Dz), the thread ID of a thread of index (x, y, z) is:
    * `= x + y*Dx + z Dx*Dy`.

_Note: Even if the programmer want to use 1, 2 or 3 dimensions for his data representation, Memory is still a 1 dimension vector at the end ..._ 

__The following code adds two matrices A and B of size NxN and stores the result into matrix C:__
```c
// Kernel definition
__global__ void MatAdd(float A[N][N], float B[N][N], float C[N][N]) {
  int i = threadIdx.x;
  int j = threadIdx.y;
  C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j];
}

int main() {
  ...
  // Kernel invocation with one block of N * N * 1 threads
  dim3 threadsPerBlock(N, N);
  MatAdd<<< 1, threadsPerBlock >>>(A, B, C);
  ...
}
```

### <A name="warp"></A> Warp

The multiprocessor creates, manages, schedules, and executes threads in groups of 32 parallel threads called warps. Individual threads composing a warp start together at the same program address, but they have their own instruction address counter and register state and are therefore free to branch and execute independently. The term warp originates from weaving, the first parallel thread technology.

![Warp](./images/warp.jpg "Warp")

When a multiprocessor is given one or more thread blocks to execute, it partitions them into warps and each warp gets scheduled by a warp scheduler for execution. The way a block is partitioned into warps is always the same; each warp contains threads of consecutive, increasing thread IDs with the first warp containing thread 0.

A warp executes one common instruction at a time, so full efficiency is realized when all 32 threads of a warp agree on their execution path. If threads of a warp diverge via a data-dependent conditional branch, the warp serially executes each branch path taken, disabling threads that are not on that path, and when all paths complete, the threads converge back to the same execution path. Branch divergence occurs only within a warp; different warps execute independently regardless of whether they are executing common or disjoint code paths.

![Thread Divergence](./images/thread_divergence.png "Thread Divergence")

The threads of a warp that are on that warp's current execution path are called the active threads, whereas threads not on the current path are inactive (disabled). Threads can be inactive because they have exited earlier than other threads of their warp, or because they are on a different branch path than the branch path currently executed by the warp, or because they are the last threads of a block whose number of threads is not a multiple of the warp size.

### <A name="block"></A> Block

Blocks are organized into a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional grid of thread blocks.

The number of threads per block and the number of blocks per grid specified in the `<<<...>>>` syntax can be of type `int` or `dim3`. Two-dimensional blocks or grids can be specified as in the example above.

* Each block within the grid can be identified by a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional index accessible within the kernel through the built-in `blockIdx` variable.
* The dimension of the thread block is accessible within the kernel through the built-in `blockDim` variable.

```c
// Kernel definition
__global__ void fooKernel( ... )
{
  unsigned int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  unsigned int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
}

int main()
{
  ...
  // Kernel invocation with 3x2 blocks of 4x3 threads
  dim3 dimGrid(3, 2, 1);
  dim3 dimBlock(4, 3, 1);
  fooKernel<<< dimGrid, dimBlock  >>>( ... );
  ...
}
```

Consequence of `fooKernel<<< dimGrid, dimBlock >>>` invocation is the launch of a Grid consisting of 3x2 Blocks with 4x3 Threads in each block:

![Thread Hierarchy](./images/grid_of_thread_blocks.png "Thread Hierarchy")

### <A name="grid"></A> Grid

There is a limit to the number of threads per block, since all threads of a block are expected to reside on the same processor core and must share the limited memory resources of that core. On current GPUs, a thread block may contain up to 1024 threads.

However, a kernel can be executed by multiple equally-shaped thread blocks, so that the total number of threads is equal to the number of threads per block times the number of blocks.

The number of thread blocks in a grid is usually dictated by the size of the data being processed or the number of processors in the system, which it can greatly exceed.

__Automatic Scalability__

Thread blocks are required to execute independently: It must be possible to execute them in any order, in parallel or in series. This independence requirement allows thread blocks to be scheduled in any order across any number of cores, enabling programmers to write code that scales with the number of cores.

A GPU is built around an array of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). A Grid is partitioned into blocks of threads that execute independently from each other, so that a GPU with more multiprocessors will automatically execute the Grid in less time than a GPU with fewer multiprocessors.

## <A name="memory"></A> Memory

The GPU card contains its own DRAM memory separatly from the CPU's DRAM.

![CUDA Compute Job](./images/cuda_compute_job.png "CUDA Compute Job")

1. A typical CUDA compute job begins by copying data to the GPU, usually to global memory.
2. The GPU then asynchronously runs the compute task it has been assigned.
3. When the host makes a call to copy memory back to host memory, the call will block until all threads have completed and the data is available, at which point results are sent back.

### <A name="hostmemory"></A> Host Memory

* __Page-Locked Host Memory (Pinned Memory)__

The CUDA runtime provides functions to allow the use of page-locked (also known as pinned) host memory (as opposed to regular pageable host memory):

Using page-locked host memory has several benefits:

* Copies between page-locked host memory and device memory can be performed concurrently with kernel execution for some devices.
* On some devices, page-locked host memory can be mapped into the address space of the device, eliminating the need to copy it to or from device memory.
* On systems with a front-side bus, bandwidth between host memory and device memory is higher if host memory is allocated as page-locked and even higher if in addition it is allocated as write-combining.

![Pinned Memory](./images/pinned_memory.jpg "Pinned Memory")

### <A name="devicememory"></A> Device Memory

CUDA threads may access data from multiple memory spaces during their execution:

* __Local memory__
    * Each thread has private local memory (__per-thread local memory__).
    * Local memory is so named because its scope is local to the thread, not because of its physical location. In fact, local memory is off-chip (=DRAM). Hence, access to local memory is as expensive as access to global memory. In other words, the term local in the name does not imply faster access.
* __Shared memory__
    * Each thread block has shared memory visible to all threads of the block and with the same lifetime as the block (__per-block shared memory__).
    * Because it is on-chip, shared memory has much higher bandwidth and lower latency than local and global memory.
* __Global memory__
    * All threads have access to the same global memory (=DRAM).

### <A name="unifiedmemory"></A>Unified Memory

Data that is shared between the CPU and GPU must be allocated in both memories, and explicitly copied between them by the program. This adds a lot of complexity to CUDA programs.

Unified Memory creates a pool of managed memory that is shared between the CPU and GPU, bridging the CPU-GPU divide. Managed memory is accessible to both the CPU and GPU using a single pointer. The key is that the system automatically migrates data allocated in Unified Memory between host and device so that it looks like CPU memory to code running on the CPU, and like GPU memory to code running on the GPU.

The CUDA runtime hides all the complexity, automatically migrating data to the place where it is accessed.

![Unified Memory](./images/unified_memory.png "Unified Memory")

An important point is that a carefully tuned CUDA program that uses streams and cudaMemcpyAsync to efficiently overlap execution with data transfers may very well perform better than a CUDA program that only uses Unified Memory. Understandably so: the CUDA runtime never has as much information as the programmer does about where data is needed and when! CUDA programmers still have access to explicit device memory allocation and asynchronous memory copies to optimize data management and CPU-GPU concurrency.

__Unified Memory is first and foremost a productivity feature that provides a smoother on-ramp to parallel computing, without taking away any of CUDA’s features for power users.__

----------------------------

## <A name="asynchronousconcurrencyexecution"></A> Asynchronous Concurrency Execution
### <A name="concurrentdataaccess"></A> Concurrent Data Access

#### <A name="threadssynchronization"></A> Threads Synchronization

Threads can access each other's results through shared and global memory: they can work together. What if a thread reads a result before another thread writes it ? __Threads need to synchronize.__

Thread blocks are required to execute independently: It must be possible to execute them in any order, in parallel or in series. This independence requirement allows thread blocks to be scheduled in any order across any number of cores, enabling programmers to write code that scales with the number of cores.

But threads within a block can cooperate by sharing data through some shared memory and by synchronizing their execution to coordinate memory accesses. More precisely, one can specify synchronization points in the kernel by calling the `__syncthreads()` intrinsic function. `__syncthreads()` acts as a barrier at which all threads in the block must wait before any is allowed to proceed.

The `__syncthreads()` command is a __block level synchronization barrier__. That means is safe to be used when all threads in a block reach the barrier.

#### <A name="atomicfunctions"></A> Atomic Functions

An atomic function performs a read-modify-write atomic operation on one 32-bit or 64-bit word residing in global or shared memory. For example, `atomicAdd()` reads a word at some address in global or shared memory, adds a number to it, and writes the result back to the same address. __The operation is atomic in the sense that it is guaranteed to be performed without interference from other threads: no other thread can access this address until the operation is complete__.

* Atomic functions can only be used in device functions.
* Atomic functions operating on mapped page-locked memory (Mapped Memory) are not atomic from the point of view of the host or other devices.

### <A name="dynamicparallelism"></A> Dynamic Parallelism

Dynamic Parallelism enables a CUDA kernel to create and synchronize new nested work, using the CUDA runtime API to launch other kernels, optionally
synchronize on kernel completion, perform device memory management, and create and use streams and events, all without CPU involvement. 

__Note: Need Compute Capability >= 3.5__

![Dynamic Parallelism](./images/dynamic_parallelism.jpg "Dynamic Parallelism")

Dynamic Parallelism dynamically spawns new threads by adapting to the data without going back to the CPU, greatly simplifying GPU programming and accelerating  algorithms.

![Dynamic Parallelism](./images/dynamic_parallelism_example.jpg "Dynamic Parallelism")

### <A name="hyperq"></A> Hyper-Q

Hyper-Q enables multiple CPU threads or processes to launch work on a single GPU simultaneously,
thereby dramatically increasing GPU utilization and slashing CPU idle times.
This feature increases the total number of “connections” between the host and GPU by
allowing 32 simultaneous, hardware-managed connections, compared to the single
connection available with GPUs without Hyper-Q.
Hyper-Q is a flexible solution that allows connections for both CUDA streams and Message
Passing Interface (MPI) processes, or even threads from within a process. Existing
applications that were previously limited by false dependencies can see a dramatic
performance increase without changing any existing code.

__Note: Need Compute Capability >= 3.5__

## <A name="multidevicesystem"></A> Multi-Device System

A host system can have multiple GPU Devices.

### <A name="streamandeventbehavior"></A> Stream and Event Behavior

* A kernel launch will fail if it is issued to a stream that is not associated to the current device.
* A memory copy will succeed even if it is issued to a stream that is not associated to the current device.
* Each device has its own default stream, so commands issued to the default stream of a device may execute out of order or concurrently with respect to commands issued to the default stream of any other device.

### <A name="gpudirect"></A> GPU Direct

**Accelerated communication with network and storage devices**  
Network and GPU device drivers can share “pinned” (page-locked) buffers, eliminating the need to make a redundant copy in CUDA host memory.

![RDMA](./images/rdma.png "RDMA")

**Peer-to-Peer Transfers between GPUs**  
Use high-speed DMA transfers to copy data between the memories of two GPUs on the same system/PCIe bus.

**Peer-to-Peer memory access**  
Optimize communication between GPUs using NUMA-style access to memory on other GPUs from within CUDA kernels.

![Peer-to-Peer](./images/peer_to_peer.png "Peer-to-Peer")

**RDMA**  

Eliminate CPU bandwidth and latency bottlenecks using remote direct memory access (RDMA) transfers between GPUs and other PCIe devices, resulting in significantly improved MPISendRecv efficiency between GPUs and other nodes)

**GPUDirect for Video**  
Optimized pipeline for frame-based devices such as frame grabbers, video switchers, HD-SDI capture, and CameraLink devices.

* GPUDirect version 1 supported accelerated communication with network and storage devices. It was supported by InfiniBand solutions available from Mellanox and others.
* GPUDirect version 2 added support for peer-to-peer communication between GPUs on the same shared memory server.
* GPU Direct RDMA enables RDMA transfers across an Infiniband network between GPUs in different cluster nodes, bypassing CPU host memory altogether. 

Using GPUDirect, 3rd party network adapters, solid-state drives (SSDs) and other devices can directly read and write CUDA host and device memory. GPUDirect eliminates unnecessary system memory copies, dramatically lowers CPU overhead, and reduces latency, resulting in significant performance improvements in data transfer times for applications running on NVIDIA products.

### <A name="curand"></A> cuRAND (Random Number)

The cuRAND library provides facilities that focus on the simple and efficient generation of high-quality pseudorandom and quasirandom numbers. A pseudorandom sequence of numbers satisfies most of the statistical properties of a truly random sequence but is generated by a deterministic algorithm. A quasirandom sequence of n -dimensional points is generated by a deterministic algorithm designed to fill an n-dimensional space evenly.

Random numbers can be generated on the device or on the host CPU.
